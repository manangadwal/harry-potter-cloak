Harry Potter invisibility cloak with the help of OpenCV and Python

Special thanks to Steve Nouri from whom I got the idea and guidance.

The logic is very simple. I am extracting each frame of the video, with the help of segmentation. 
I separate the background and foreground of the image. 
I replace the foreground of a particular color with the background which gives the illusion of getting disappeared.
